# InPantry

## Getting Started

This repository is my group's mobile inventory app, InPantry, that was developed with the basis of being an Inventory Management Software within our Software Engineering course. 
As a group we had 12/15 weeks of our semester to complete this software. Every four weeks we were met with the requirement of showing the application's progress in a class presentation in the hypothetical
of showing our progress to our company's, J.J.BIC, stakeholders. 
This project allowed for the learning, experience, and creation of a software, along with what it truly takes to create any software under the pressure of a short 15 week deadline that we had even less time than.

A few resources to get you started if this is your first Flutter project:

- [Cookbook: Useful Flutter samples](https://docs.flutter.dev/cookbook)

[online documentation](https://docs.flutter.dev/), which offers tutorials,
samples, guidance on mobile development, and a full API reference.

## Outline

Inventory Software made into a mobile app for every day use in the average household.

Built with the Flutter foundation of the coding language Dart. This was done in the VS Code IDE. This was how our front end was built and edited.

Our backend was created and maintained using Firebase. Specifically wihtin Firebase we utilized their Authentication and Realtime Database features.
Authentication was used in our Sign In/Sign Out/Sign Up pages which allowed us to confirm users and securely protect our app from users that were unwanted.
Within our auth features, there were password length, and character, requirements for every users' passwords. 
This also allowed for us to add more auth features such as if the user forgot their password. 

Our database then too this data from Authentication to seperate and create unique sessions for every signed in, or not signed in(anonymous), users. This really was conveinient for users to be able to track
their own personal lists and not sharing with other users.
